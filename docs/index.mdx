# Intro

A Gradle plugin for easy testing of Kotlin Multiplatform projects in your CI pipeline.

- Support for testing `android()` targets on the emulator or a connected device.
  The plugin takes care of downloading SDK components, identifying the correct platform
  and system image, spinning up a well configured emulator and run the tests.

- Support for testing `androidNative*()` binaries on the emulator or a connected device.
  Just like JVM-based android targets, the plugin takes care of the emulator setup
  and ensures that the device will be able to run the target architecture.
